# node_chatroom
The standard first Node.js project is a chatroom app, so I made a chatroom app in order to familiarize myself with the workings of Node.js + socket.io.

# TO DO
- Add when message was read in private chats
- Create private group chats
- Top bar to manage all chats?
- Notifications when receiving a message out of focus
