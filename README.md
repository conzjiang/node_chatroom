# node_chatroom
The standard first Node.js project is a chatroom app, so I made a chatroom app in order to familiarize myself with the workings of Node.js + socket.io.

# TO DO
- Fix positioning when resizing window
- Notifications when receiving a message out of focus

# Nice to have
- Make socket a singleton object
- Style messages
- Add when message was read in private chats
- Create private group chats
- Focus on main chat textarea when scrolling to it
- Top bar to manage all chats?
