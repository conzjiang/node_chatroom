# node_chatroom
The standard first Node.js project is a chatroom app, so I made a chatroom app in order to familiarize myself with the workings of Node.js + socket.io.

# TO DO
- On nickname change, change every instance of previous nickname to new nickname
- Show typing status in private chats
- Add when message was read in private chats
- Create private group chats
